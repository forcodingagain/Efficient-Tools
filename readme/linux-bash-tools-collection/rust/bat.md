# Bat

## Features

### Syntax highlighting

`bat` supports syntax highlighting for a large number of programming and markup languages

### Git integration

`bat` communicates with `git` to show modifications with respect to the index (see left side bar)

### Show non-printable characters

You can use the `-A`/`--show-all` option to show and highlight non-printable characters

### Automatic paging

By default, `bat` pipes its own output to a pager (e.g. `less`) if the output is too large for one screen. If you would rather `bat` work like `cat` all the time (never page output), you can set `--paging=never` as an option, either on the command line or in your configuration file. If you intend to alias `cat` to `bat` in your shell configuration, you can use `alias cat='bat --paging=never'` to preserve the default behavior.

#### **File concatenation**

Even with a pager set, you can still use `bat` to concatenate files ðŸ˜‰. Whenever `bat` detects a non-interactive terminal (i.e. when you pipe into another process or into a file), `bat` will act as a drop-in replacement for `cat` and fall back to printing the plain file contents, regardless of the `--pager` option's value.

## How to use

Display a single file on the terminal

```bash
> bat README.md
```

Display multiple files at once

```
> bat src/*.rs
```

Read from stdin, determine the syntax automatically (note, highlighting will only work if the syntax can be determined from the first line of the file, usually through a shebang such as `#!/bin/sh`)

```bash
> curl -s https://sh.rustup.rs | bat
```

Read from stdin, specify the language explicitly

```bash
> yaml2json .travis.yml | json_pp | bat -l json
```

Show and highlight non-printable characters

```bash
> bat -A /etc/hosts
```

Use it as a `cat` replacement:

```bash
bat > note.md  # quickly create a new file

bat header.md content.md footer.md > document.md

bat -n main.rs  # show line numbers (only)

bat f - g  # output 'f', then stdin, then 'g'.
```
